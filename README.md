### An admin panel for Docpad?

_I know there has been [a lot of talk](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/123) about defining a roadmap to build a docpad GUI, but I needed an admin panel with basic CMS features right now, so I just made one. It is far from being perfect but it works._

### Key features

* Configure everything on your docpad.coffee file: **admin path**, **password**, **lists**, **filters**, **forms**…
* List and Manage your content with a very easy user interface
* Create forms to edit your content with built-in components: **datepicker**, **wysiwyg**, **markdown**, **image upload**, **tags with autocomplete**…

## How to use

Run ```npm install docpad-plugin-minicms```

Then, you should definitely take a look at the [docpad.coffee](https://github.com/jeremyfa/docpad-plugin-minicms/blob/master/examples/blog/docpad.coffee) file of the blog example project in order to know how to configure the plugin.
