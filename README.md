### An admin panel for Docpad?

_I know there has been [a lot of talk](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/123) about defining a roadmap for making a docpad GUI, but I needed an admin panel with basic CMS features right now, so I just made one. It is far from being perfect but **it works**._

### Key features

* Configure everything on your docpad.coffee file: **admin path**, **password**, **lists**, **filters**, **forms**…
* List and Manage your content with a very easy user interface
* Create forms to edit your content with built-in components: **datepicker**, **wysiwyg**, **markdown**, **image upload**…

## How to use

Run ```npm install docpad-plugin-minicms```

Then take a look the blog example project (in _examples/blog_ directory) to learn how to configure your project's admin panel.
